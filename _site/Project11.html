  <h3 class="post-title"> Independent Study and Consulting work in Belgium for KU Leuven and Thomas Moore</h3>
  </header>
  <article class="post-content">
    <p>During my semester abroad in Belgium, I was a liaison of Olin College to two universities in Belgium: KU Leuven and Thomas Moore. I have been working directly with Inge Vervoot and her colleagues on her mission to engage engineering students in real world experience and expose them to the social sector. In order to accomplish this, the programs will be emphasizing user centered design, design thinking, real world experiences and societal awareness and the social profit sector. This group is working on a number of projects, some of which span the European Union. As a student of Olin College, I assisted this team in two of their programs, which will be explained below. I will be using my experience as a student at Olin College, my design and education courses, and the knowledge Iâ€™ve acquired while working for the Collaboratory to write recommendations and proposals to the group. </p>

<p>The first program that I worked with is Community Service Engineering, or CSE. CSE has been developed by Inge and her colleague Jan to educate recent graduates or professionals as to being socially aware engineers. A larger, longer existing program called the Postgraduate Programme in Innovation and Entrepreneurship in Engineering, has a complementary mission. To enhance both programs, they decided to integrate them. As an outsider with experience in curriculum and user centered design, I gave my opinions and perspective to best integrate the programs to attract more students and give them the best educational opportunities. In order to best accomplish this, I have met with students from both programs who are working on a variety of projects as well as coaches, mentors and administrators of the programs, as well as attended CSE to get the best vantage point of the course. You can read my proposal <a href="https://www.dropbox.com/s/o3n20tam538soha/FINALintegrationReport.pdf?dl=0">here</a>.</p>

<p>The second program I worked with is the Social Ingenious degree supplement at Thomas Moore. At Thomas Moore University, they value having well rounded graduates. The project directors, Inge and Jan, are working to design a degree supplement for bachelor engineering students of some majors and campuses of Thomas Moore. This degree supplement will fit into their existing degree and only require one extra course of 3 ECTS. I have been in meetings with Jan and the department heads of the respective majors to understand the current curriculum set-up, the goals of the program and the opinions of both parties. I have also met with many students to see what they value and desire for their programs.  I have used these experiences in user centered design workshops that I have conducted for Inge and Jan to help understand their students better and design a great program. You can read this proposal <a href="https://www.dropbox.com/s/6bqx4wtqsdgn9e0/SocialIngeniusReport.pdf?dl=0">here</a>.</p>

<p>I ran workshops for the teaching team where they used the design process to develop their curriculum, bringing the theories the professors were attempting to teach into practice.  I converted their office into a design space, with butcher paper and post-its covering the walls, in which user interviews drove the brainstorming content. I provided the professors the exposure to the design process required to internalize how to teach the process to students. This experience helped me realize the importance of exposing STEM and design teachers to innovative learning styles and provided me the opportunity to reflect on the challenges of transforming heavily constrained traditional programs into innovative classrooms.</p>
