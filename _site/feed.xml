        <title>19: Designing a Growth Mindset Development Environment for Novice Programmers</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;I am working with Professor Eleanor O’Rourke on understanding how mindset is enacted in programming behaviors. We are currently exploring how other psychological constructs may be influencing the measurement and influence of mindset on behaviors. We hope to use our findings to design technology to help the motivation and persistence of novice programmers.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>18: Coaching in Design Problem-based Learning</title>

&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We are studying the challenges and the process of being a coach in ill-structured problem-based learning environments. During Summer 2017, I worked with a team of researchers on designing learning environments that helps student teams effectively iterate for highly ill-structured design problems. We proposed that we can support iteration by (a) facilitating discussions, guiding the planning process, and encouraging teams to prioritize the riskiest parts of their project; (b) providing and teaching the use of two external representations, the design canvas and iteration plan; and (c) providing and promoting prompts and questions to surface common pitfalls. We found that by using our design, student teams iterated more and conducted more testing with users. This work helps inform designers of learning environments for design education. Additionally, from this work, we better understand the support that students need to learn iteration.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This work was presented at the International Conference for the Learning Sciences in London in June 2018:&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>17: TunePad - A Sound Composition Tablet App for Introducing Computational Thinking</title>
        <description>&lt;!-- &lt;h2&gt; A Sound Composition Tablet App for Introducing Computational Thinking &lt;/h2&gt; --&gt;
&lt;center&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;images/projects/tangibleTunepad.PNG&quot; width=&quot;30%&quot; /&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Starting in March 2018, I will be rejoining the TunePad team to investigate how we can promote a growth mindset in students learning to program in TunePad.&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;TunePad is preparing for a public release June 30th 2018. I am working with the TunePad team, specifically on error messages, feedback and growth mindset.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;I started working on TunePad in September 2016 and conducting the initial prototyping for the project.&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Computational thinking skills will be important for the next generation of students. However, there is a disparity in the populations joining the field. Integrating computational thinking into artistic fields has shown to increase participation in computer science. In this paper, we present our initial design prototype for TunePad,  From our preliminary testing, with children ages 7-14, we observed that our design actively engages learners and communicates how the programming blocks control the sounds being played. This testing is a prelude to more formal studies as we continue to improve the design and interface of TunePad. With this work, we intend to engage students in computational thinking who may not have otherwise been exposed, giving the opportunity to more people to enter the computer science field.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;TunePad is a a sound composition tablet application controlled by a block-based programming environment. TunePad is designed to introduce middle-school aged learners to computational thinking and to prepare them for text-based coding environments. The project is a collaboration between the &lt;a href=&quot;http://adamlab.gatech.edu/&quot;&gt;Adam Lab&lt;/a&gt; at Georgia Tech University and the &lt;a href=&quot;http://tidal.northwestern.edu/&quot;&gt; TIDAL lab &lt;/a&gt; at Northwestern University.  With this work, we intend to engage students in computational thinking who may not have otherwise been exposed, giving the opportunity to more people to enter the computer science field.  We hope to  balance playful, informal learning while also preparing learners for formal computing environments, like &lt;a href=&quot;https://earsketch.gatech.edu/landing/&quot;&gt;EarSketch&lt;/a&gt;, a computational music remixing tool.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A WIP poster of TunePad was presented at Interaction Design and Children Conference at Stanford University in June 2017.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>16: Current Project: Hands-on Learning for Rural India</title>
        <description>&lt;center&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;images/projects/ADE/IMG_1632.JPG&quot; width=&quot;35%&quot; /&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;images/projects/ADE/IMG_1791.JPG&quot; width=&quot;35%&quot; /&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Many traditional science educational systems are based on root memorization, discouraging many students from an interest in science and math. By providing exploratory and tangible experiences in science classrooms, students will relate more to the field and could develop a strong curiosity for science.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My team of engineering and business students and professors worked with two partners, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.agastya.org/&quot;&gt;Agastya International Foundation&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.africanwomenadvocacyproject.org/&quot;&gt;African Women Advocacy Project&lt;/a&gt; to develop the Brightbox. The Brightbox is a tangible projector that emitted light rays which students can manipulate with accessories to discover the principles of optics. We created an exploratory and hands-on curriculum to accompany this Brightbox in middle-aged science classrooms. In the winter of 2016 I went to India to work with manufacturers on the design of the ray projector and test our device and curriculum in village classrooms. The Brightboxes will travel between classrooms in rural India to allow a large quantity of children to access them. I project-managed this endeavor and was the lead in developing the accompanying curriculum.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Above left, you can see students in village school working with the Brightbox. Above right, you can see students at Agastya in a lesson with the Brightbox. At the bottom, you can see me working with the team on the manufacturing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The project is still ongoing at Olin with a goal to supply Agastya with the first 500 Brightboxes and provide the ability for Agastya to build 500 more every year.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;center&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

        <title>13: Computational Robotics</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Below are two projects featured from a Computational Robotics Course at Olin College.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt; AudioDog - Machine Learning and Localization from Audio Data &lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My team and I made a robot which recognized different commands based on the emotion detected in a voice and then completed the respective action, as a dog would. One of those actions was localizing the direction of the noise and moving towards it. &lt;a href=&quot;https://teamaudiodog.weebly.com&quot;&gt;Check out our website!&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;h2&gt; Robot guided by head tilt and pan - Computer Vision Project &lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We developed a dataset, model and software to interpret the head tilt and pan of any user. The head tilt determined how fast the robot moved and the head pan determined angular velocity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here is the video of our project in action:&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>11: Bringing Design Thinking to Belgium</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;In the Spring of 2015, I traveled to Belgium to do a semester-long independent study in engineering education and to incorporate design thinking and collaboration into university engineering programs. I used qualitative research techniques to study the current state of the bachelors and postgraduate programs at two renowned universities in Belgium, KU Leuven and Thomas More. At my first classroom visit, the students gave a mid-year update on their project. Although they were supposed to have a component of user centered design, one of the students failed to even articulate who his users were! The professors were lost, arguing that they provided the students readings on the method. In this moment, I realized that since the professors themselves had never experienced the design process, they were not able to effectively teach it. In response, I ran workshops for the teaching team where they used the design process to develop their curriculum, bringing the theories the professors were attempting to teach into practice.  I converted their office into a design space, with butcher paper and post-its covering the walls, in which user interviews drove the brainstorming content. I provided the professors the exposure to the design process required to internalize how to teach the process to students. This experience helped me realize the importance of exposing STEM and design teachers to innovative learning styles and provided me the opportunity to reflect on the challenges of transforming heavily constrained traditional programs into innovative classrooms. In the end, the experience allowed me to impact the programs in two Belgian universities, as well as learn about conducting independent research, gathering and processing data, writing proposals, and developing workshops.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#&quot; class=&quot;read_more&quot;&gt;Show More&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;a href=&quot;#&quot; class=&quot;read_less&quot; style=&quot;display:none&quot;&gt;Show Less&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;more_text&quot; style=&quot;display:none&quot;&gt;



&lt;h3&gt; More details of the programs: &lt;/h3&gt;

I worked directly with Inge Vervoot and her colleagues on a mission to engage engineering students in real world experiences and expose them to the social sector. In order to accomplish this, the programs emphasizes user centered design, design thinking, real world experiences and societal awareness and the social profit sector. This group works on a number of projects, some of which in partnerships which span the European Union. As a student of Olin College, I assisted this team on two of their programs, explained below. I used my experience as a student at Olin College, my design and education courses, and the knowledge I’ve acquired while working for the Collaboratory to write recommendations and proposals to the group. 
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The first program that I worked with is &lt;a href=&quot;https://onderwijsaanbod.kuleuven.be/2015/opleidingen/e/CQ_52973286.htm#activetab=diploma_omschrijving&quot;&gt; Community Service Engineering&lt;/a&gt;, or CSE. CSE has been developed by Inge and her colleague Jan to educate recent graduates or professionals as to being socially aware engineers. There is a larger, longer existing program called the Postgraduate Programme in Innovation and Entrepreneurship in Engineering which is also in the school of engineering and has a complementary mission. To enhance both programs, they decided to integrate them. As an outsider with experience in curriculum and user centered design, I gave my opinions and perspective to best integrate the programs to attract more students and give them the most beneficial educational opportunities. In order to best accomplish this, I  met with students from both programs who are working on a variety of projects as well as coaches, mentors and administrators of the programs. I attended the CSE classtime to get the best vantage point of the course. You can read my proposal &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dropbox.com/s/o3n20tam538soha/FINALintegrationReport.pdf?dl=0&quot;&gt; here&lt;/a&gt;.
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The second program that I worked with is the Social Ingenious bachelor's degree supplement at Thomas More. At Thomas More, they value having well rounded graduates. The project directors, Inge and Jan, are working to design a degree supplement for bachelor engineering students of some majors and campuses of Thomas More. This degree supplement will fit into their existing degree and only require one extra course of 3 ECTS. I conducted meetings with Jan and the department heads of the respective majors to understand the current curriculum set-up, the goals of the program and the opinions of both parties. I  also met with many students to see what they value and desire for their programs. You can read this proposal &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dropbox.com/s/6bqx4wtqsdgn9e0/SocialIngeniusReport.pdf?dl=0&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
I ran workshops for the teaching team where they used the design process to develop their curriculum, bringing the theories the professors were attempting to teach into practice.  I converted their office into a design space, with butcher paper and post-its covering the walls, in which user interviews drove the brainstorming content. I provided the professors the exposure to the design process required to internalize how to teach the process to students. This experience helped me realize the importance of exposing STEM and design teachers to innovative learning styles and provided me the opportunity to reflect on the challenges of transforming heavily constrained traditional programs into innovative classrooms.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://jamiesarahg.weebly.com/education-blog&quot;&gt;Throughout my semester, I kept a blog about the work that I was doing.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;script text=&quot;text/javascript&quot;&gt;
    $('a.read_more').click(function(event){ /* find all a.read_more elements and bind the following code to them */

        event.preventDefault(); /* prevent the a from changing the url */
        // $(this).parents('.item').find('.more_text').show(); /* show the .more_text span */
        $('.more_text').show(); /* show the .more_text span */
        $('.read_less').show(); /* show the .more_text span */
        $('.read_more').hide(); /* show the .more_text span */

    });
    $('a.read_less').click(function(event){ /* find all a.read_more elements and bind the following code to them */

        event.preventDefault(); /* prevent the a from changing the url */
        // $(this).parents('.item').find('.more_text').show(); /* show the .more_text span */
        $('.more_text').hide(); /* show the .more_text span */
        $('.read_less').hide(); /* show the .more_text span */
        $('.read_more').show(); /* show the .more_text span */
    });
&lt;/script&gt;

        <title>10: Discrete Math Evaluation of the Enigma Machine</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;For a discrete mathmatics course, my team and I evaluated the Enigma machine. The Enigma machine was used by the Germans to encode messages that were to be sent via radio in World War II. WWII may have ended differently if the code was not cracked. The code was impressive, but the Germans made mistakes in implementing it, which led to its downfall. We calculated the total number of encodings that were possible with the Enigma machine and then compared it to the number of encodings possibe with all of the mistakes the Germans made using discrete math principles.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dropbox.com/s/8bddzbijhv4uj9j/Enigma_Machine.pdf?dl=0&quot;&gt;See an explanation of our work!&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

        <title>8: S2 - User Centered Design</title>
        <description>&lt;center&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;images/projects/UOCDposter.png&quot; width=&quot;95%&quot; /&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For Olin’s User Oriented Collaborative Design course, I worked on a team to understand and design for volunteer physicians. In a semester, we were tasked to design something which would make a significant impact on the lives of Volunteer Physicians. The team, four other students and myself, engaged in a User Centered Design process where we challenged ourselves to epathize and understand our users. We visited clinics and hospitals, interviewed physicians and investigated other stakeholders. We identified areas of opportunities, which helped us build frameworks, like personas and journeys, to extract deeper meaning. Once we had a full understanding of the values and needs of our users, we ferociously ideated and strategically codesigned.
In the end, we developed the S2, an intelligent note-taking add-on to a stethoscope. Many volunteer physicians resent the overhaul of their field by technology and reject doctors who spend their appointment time glued to the computer instead of interacting with patients. We were able to turn their apprehension towards technology into an asset by designing a device which would help the physicians increase time interacting with their patients.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt; Below is our slide deck which details the design processes we went through &lt;/h4&gt;

        <title>7: Prescribing Drugs in UK: A Data Science Project</title>
        <description>&lt;center&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;images/projects/lesspeaks.jpg&quot; width=&quot;50%&quot; /&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For a data science course, my partner and I evaluated the reactions of doctors to directives published by the National Health Service of the UK. We worked with the National Healh Service’s Open Data that they published in a transparency initiative. Specifically, we analyzed how doctors responded to different actions by the NHS with two specific NSAID’s. We built a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dropbox.com/s/eviombgon1jb9ji/NSAIDmapTimeseries.avi?dl=0&quot;&gt;timeseries&lt;/a&gt; which displays how well each of the different regions reacted to the directive.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dropbox.com/s/z354fimlei0zgcu/NHS___Data_Science.pdf?dl=0&quot;&gt;See our final report&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
