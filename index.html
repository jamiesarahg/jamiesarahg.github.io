        I am a PhD student in <a href="https://csls.sesp.northwestern.edu/">Computer Science and Learning Sciences</a>, a joint Ph.D. program at  <a href="http://northwestern.edu "  target="_blank">Northwestern University</a> between the McCormick School of Engineering and the School of Education and Social Policy. I am interested in <b>designing and building technology that increases student engagement and motivation,</b> particularily in hands-on or project-based environments. I conduct research in the <a href="http://delta.northwestern.edu/">Delta Lab</a> with <a href="http://www.eleanorourke.com/"  target="_blank">Professor Eleanor O'Rourke</a>. We work on understanding how programming students evaluate their intelligence, with the goal of developing technology to increase student persistence. I received my B.S. from <a href="http://olin.edu"  target="_blank">Olin College of Engineering</a> in Electrical and Computer Engineering with a concentration in Innovative Education. My research is funded by the<a href="https://www.nsfgrfp.org/"  target="_blank"> National Science Foundation Graduate Research Fellowship Program</a> in the field of STEM Ed and a NSF CRII grant.
