        I am a PhD student in Computer Science and Learning Sciences, a joint Ph.D. program at  <a href="http://northwestern.edu "  target="_blank">Northwestern University</a>. I am interested in <b>designing and building technology that increases student engagement and motivation in hands-on and project-based learning environments.  
</b> I am currently conducting research in the <a href="http://delta.northwestern.edu/">Delta Lab</a> with <a href="http://www.eleanorourke.com/"  target="_blank">Professor Eleanor O'Rourke</a>. I received my B.S. from <a href="http://olin.edu"  target="_blank">Olin College of Engineering</a> in Electrical and Computer Engineering with a concentration in Innovative Education. My research is funded by the<a href="https://www.nsfgrfp.org/"  target="_blank"> National Science Foundation Graduate Research Fellowship Program</a> in the field of STEM Ed.
