        I am a PhD Candidate in <a href="https://csls.sesp.northwestern.edu/">Computer Science and Learning Sciences</a> at  <a href="http://northwestern.edu "  target="_blank">Northwestern University</a>. I conduct research to understand student motivations and emotions in learning environments, using mixed methods and technological tools with the goal of designing and building technology that increases student engagement and motivation. I am in the <a href="http://delta.northwestern.edu/">Delta Lab</a> working with <a href="http://www.eleanorourke.com/"  target="_blank">Professor Eleanor O'Rourke</a>. We work to understand the moments during the programming process where students feel like they are performing poorly through mixed methods including learning analytics. I received my B.S. from <a href="http://olin.edu"  target="_blank">Olin College of Engineering</a> in Electrical and Computer Engineering with a concentration in Innovative Education. My research is funded by the<a href="https://www.nsfgrfp.org/"  target="_blank"> National Science Foundation Graduate Research Fellowship Program</a> in the field of STEM Ed and a NSF CRII grant.
