        I am a PhD student at  <a href="http://northwestern.edu">Northwestern University</a> in <a href="http://tsb.northwestern.edu">Technology and Social Behavior</a>, a combined program in Computer Science and Communications. My interest is in designing and building technology to increase hands-on and project-based learning for formal and informal educational spaces. I am currently working in the <a href="http://delta.northwestern.edu/">Delta Lab</a> with <a href="http://matteasterday.com/">Professor Matthew Easterday</a>  and in the <a href="http://tidal.northwestern.edu/">TIDAL Lab</a> with<a href="http://tidal.northwestern.edu/people/mikehorn/"> Professor Michael Horn</a>. In the labs, I work with students in both Computer Sciences and Learning Sciences disciplines. I received my B.S. from <a href="http://olin.edu">Olin College of Engineering</a> in Electrical and Computer Engineering with a concentration in Innovative Education. My research is funded by the<a href="https://www.nsfgrfp.org/"> National Science Foundation Graduate Research Fellowship Program</a> in the field of STEM Ed.
