<h1>Hello, word!</h1>
<p>
  Hi! I am a Computer Engineering Student at Franklin W. Olin College of Engineering. My goal is to develop technology which can help make project-based and hands-on learning accessible to a larger audience of people. This comes from an interest in innovative education, robotics, embedded systems and software development.
