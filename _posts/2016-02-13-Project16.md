In an Affordable Design and Entrepreneurship program I worked on a project to increase the education standard in India and Ghana through developing a hands-on learning educational technology and accompanying curriculum.  My team of engineering and business students and professors are working with two partners, [Agastya International Foundation](http://www.agastya.org/) and [African Women Advocacy Project](http://www.africanwomenadvocacyproject.org/). We developed a ray projector, called the Brightbox, to encourage exploration and curiousity in students when teaching optics in middle-aged science classrooms. In the winter of 2016 I went  to India to work with manufacturers on the design of the ray projector and test our device and curriculum in village classrooms. Above left, you can see students in village school working with the Brightbox. Above right, you can see students at Agastya in a lesson with the Brightbox. At the bottom, you can see me working with the team on the manufacturing. The project is still ongoing at Olin with a goal to supply Agastya with the first 500 Brightboxes and provide the ability for Agastya to build 500 more every year.
