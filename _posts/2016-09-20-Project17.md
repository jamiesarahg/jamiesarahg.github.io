TunePad is a tablet-based application that uses computational techniques to compose music. The intention is to introduce computational thinking to middle aged students (9-14). The project is a collaboration between the <a href="http://adamlab.gatech.edu/">Adam Lab</a> at Georgia Tech University and the <a href="http://tidal.northwestern.edu/"> TIDAL lab </a> at Northwestern University. Our goal is to make the application to allow for repetitive uses so that it prepares students for more formal programming environments, like <a href="http://earsketch.gatech.edu/landing/#/">Earsketch</a>, a computational music remixing tool. We are working on a couple of designs and testing with students at a music school. We are also considering the advantages of including tangible aspects to the project.
