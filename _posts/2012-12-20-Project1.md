For our Design Nature project, we built an owl game. The assignment was to make a biologically inspired toy for fourth graders that transported something. We went through many iterations, as flying is not an easy motion to mimac. We had to address safety concerns and make sure the game was fun. Since at Olin no project can end without a real-world connection, bus-loads of fourth graders tested and evaluated our project. This semester gave us a new way of approaching learning and academics, one where we drive our studies and take risks to build a better product.
