@IntroduceMeTo is a half-semester project that employed data mining, parsing, natural language processing, and remote API integration to make a bot that brings professional introductions, usually made on LinkedIn (a professional social network), to Twitter, (a unidirectional communication network), where interacting with complete strangers is acceptable.

Specifically, I worked on the backend of @IntroduceMeTo, developing the NLP algorithms that matched inputted tweets with LinkedIn profiles and returning this to the user. This involved filtering both tweet content and text from LinkedIn profiles and creating and implementing a ranking system for LinkedIn profile content.
