For our Design Nature course, I worked on of team of four to create a walking crab toy. This project was my first exposure to User-Oriented Design, the process by which you design a product for a specific user group - in our case, fourth grade students. We learned about incremental design during the course of this project. First, we created sketch models, then a working proof of concept, then the initial prototype, and finally constructed a final product and demoed it live to a forth grade audience (who graded us).

This was a project where all four teammates were involved in every step of the project. With my teammates, I worked on how to make a robotic crab toy targeted to fourth grade users, the initial drawings of how the crab would function, CAD, and the implementation of the design.

Teammates: Charlie Behling, Carl Bailey, Matt Reiley
