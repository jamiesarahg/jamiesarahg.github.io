Below are two projects featured from a Computational Robotics Course.

<h2> AudioDog - Machine Learning and Localization from Audio Data </h2>

For our final, we are making a robot which recognizes different commands based on the emotion in the voice and follows different actions based on the command, as a dog would. One of those actions is localizing the direction of the noise and moving towards it.

<h2> Robot guided by head tilt and pan - Computer Vision Project </h2>

For a Computational Robotics course, we developed a dataset, model and software to interpret the head tilt and pan of any user. The head tilt determined how fast the robot moved and the head pan determined angular velocity.

Here is the video of our project in action:
