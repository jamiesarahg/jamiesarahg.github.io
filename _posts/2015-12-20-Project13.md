Below are two projects featured from a Computational Robotics Course at Olin College.

<h2> AudioDog - Machine Learning and Localization from Audio Data </h2>

My team and I made a robot which recognized different commands based on the emotion detected in a voice and then completed the respective action, as a dog would. One of those actions was localizing the direction of the noise and moving towards it. [Check out our website!](https://teamaudiodog.weebly.com)

<h2> Robot guided by head tilt and pan - Computer Vision Project </h2>

We developed a dataset, model and software to interpret the head tilt and pan of any user. The head tilt determined how fast the robot moved and the head pan determined angular velocity.

Here is the video of our project in action:
