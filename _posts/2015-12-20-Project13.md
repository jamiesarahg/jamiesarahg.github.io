<h2> Robot guided by head tilt and pan - Computer Vision Project </h2>

For a computational robotics course, we developed a dataset, model and software to interpret the head tilt and pan of any user. The head tilt determined how fast the robot moved and the head pan determined angular velocity.

Here is the video of our project in action:
