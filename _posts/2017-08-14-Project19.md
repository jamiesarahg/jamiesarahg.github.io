I am working with Professor Eleanor O'Rourke on understanding how novice programming students percieve programming intellience. We are trying to understand how mindset interacts with students' criteria for evaluating their intelligence. We are currently exploring how other psychological constructs may be influencing the measurement and influence of mindset on behaviors. We hope to use our findings to design technology to help the motivation and persistence of novice programmers.
