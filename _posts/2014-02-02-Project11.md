A new project every week. Check out [my "How To Make" page](http://fab.cba.mit.edu/classes/863.14/people/juliana_nazare/index.html) for more. 

For my final project, I decided to make a "phone-like" object that allows people to dial a number via Skype. The goal is to give this to my grandma as a holiday present, so that she can Skype with her brother in San Diego. Check out a video demo of the working phone:

Creating this working phone took me a good part of a week, and I have tried to [document my progress in each step](http://fab.cba.mit.edu/classes/863.14/people/juliana_nazare/final_project.html).
