For a discrete mathmatics course, my team and I evaluated the Enigma machine. The Enigma machine was used by the Germans to encode messages that were to be sent via radio in World War II. WWII may have ended differently if the code was not cracked. The code was impressive, but the Germans made mistakes in implementing it, which led to its downfall. We calculated the total number of encodings that were possible with the Enigma machine and then compared it to the number of encodings possibe with all of the mistakes the Germans made using discrete math principles.
