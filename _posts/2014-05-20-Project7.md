For a data science course, my partner and I evaluated the reactions of doctors to directives published by the National Health Service of the UK. We worked with the National Healh Service's Open Data that they published in a transparency initiative. Specifically, we analyzed how doctors responded to different actions by the NHS with two specific NSAID's. We built a [timeseries](https://www.dropbox.com/s/eviombgon1jb9ji/NSAIDmapTimeseries.avi?dl=0) which displays how well each of the different regions reacted to the directive.
