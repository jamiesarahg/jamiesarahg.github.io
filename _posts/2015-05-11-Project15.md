I’m currently working on a project in an Affordable Design and Entrepreneurship course to increase hands-on learning and curiosity in STEM fields in India and Ghana with business and engineering students and professors. We are working with two partners, [Agastya International Foundation](http://www.agastya.org/) and [African Women's Advocacy Project](http://www.africanwomenadvocacyproject.org/). We are developing a ray projector, called the [BrightBox](http://brightbox1.weebly.com/), and curriculum as material for the teaching of optics. In January, we will be going to India to deliver the first iteration of this product. This project is going to be included in Agastya's Lab in a Box program, which brings hands-on science curriculum to rural, underserved schools in India.  In the Lab in a Box program, a trainer brings the curriculum and projector to the teacher and instructs them on how to run the labs.  Our eventual goal is to send 600 boxes to the Lab in a Box program reaching across India, as well as a few hundred to African Women’s Advocacy Group in Ghana. 

We have made great progress this semester both in development of the box and curriculum. I am the Project Manager of the team, so part of my role is to coordinate the three other engineering students, the three business students, two advisors and the class. I have been working on the electrical circuit and spend most of my effort developing the curriculum.

Our first prototype went to Ghana in October and was tested by the African Women's Advocacy Project

In the middle of November, we brought the BrightBox to a local classroom to observe the students interacting with the box as well as the completeness of the teacher instructions.

We will be launching our Kickstarter to raise funds for this project soon!
