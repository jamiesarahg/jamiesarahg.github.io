I’m currently working on a project in an Affordable Design and Entrepreneurship course to increase hands-on learning and curiosity in STEM fields in India and Ghana with business and engineering students and professors. We are developing a light-projector and curriculum to aid in the teaching of optics. In January, we will be going to India to deliver the first iteration of this product to Agastya International Foundation, one of our partnering institutions. Agastya runs a Lab in a Box program to bring hands-on science curriculum to rural, underserved schools in India.  In the Lab in a Box program, a trainer brings the curriculum and projector to the teacher and instructs them on how to run the labs.  Our eventual goal is to send 600 boxes to the Lab in a Box program reaching across India, as well as a few hundred to African Women’s Advocacy Group in Ghana. 

Here is the product being tested in Ghana
