I am currently working with [Philipp Schmidt](https://twitter.com/schmidtphi) and [Katherine McConachie](https://twitter.com/kamcconachie) on a research project to create digital certificates that are registered and verified through the blockchain.

* Much more about this project can be found on the project site, [http://certs.media.mit.edu](http://certs.media.mit.edu)
