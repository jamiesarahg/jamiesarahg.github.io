For my Senior Capstone Project in Engineering, I am building a design application for children aged four to fourteen in conjunction with DS SolidWorks. As the Product Owner, I ensure that the team is going on the correct path to both meet the team’s goals and DS SolidWorks’ objectives. This includes convincing DS SolidWorks to change their designs based on evidence corroborated by our user research. While the product is under NDA, I can divulge that it will expose students to the creative aspects of engineering, which may encourage females and underrepresented groups to pursue engineering study. The demographic is kids 4 to 14 years of age, from Kindergarten to 8th grade. The app should inspire the kids and prepare them to tackle their own projects. This application will open young eyes to the design process, motivating and preparing them to tackle their own projects.
