Iâ€™m currently working on a project in an Affordable Design and Entrepreneurship course to increase hands-on learning and curiosity in STEM fields in India and Ghana with business and engineering students and professors. We are working with two partners, [Agastya International Foundation](http://www.agastya.org/) and [African Women Advocacy Project](http://www.africanwomenadvocacyproject.org/). We are developing a ray projector, called the Brightbox, and curriculum as material for the teaching of optics. In January, we will be going to India to deliver the first iteration of this product. This project is going to be included in Agastya's <i>Lab in a Box</i> program, which brings hands-on science curriculum to rural, underserved schools in India.  In the Lab in a Box program, a trainer brings the curriculum and projector to the teacher and instructs them on how to run the labs.  Our eventual goal is to send 600 boxes to be deployed in the Lab in a Box program, to be distributed across India, as well as a few hundred to African Women Advocacy Group in Ghana. 

We have made great progress this semester both in development of the box and curriculum. My role on the team is the Project Manager. I keep the team on track to succeed and balance communication amongst the three other engineering students, three business students, two advisors and our partners. I also focus on curriculum development and help on the electrical team. Our first prototype went to Ghana in October and was tested by the African Women Advocacy Project

In the middle of November and the beginning of December, I tested our prototypes and curriculum in two Massachusetts classrooms and observed as each teacher taught our lesson and students interacted with the technology.

Soon, we will be launching our fundraising campaign to raise funds for this project soon.
