I am a member of the team which conceptualized, designed, and built an autonomous playing guitar. The mechatronic system interfaces with an Arduino Uno and a Python software base. The software inputes tablature formatted music and plays the songs through a system of solenoids that push frets and lock actuators that pluck the strings. I was in charge of all of the software systems, both the python backend and arduino controller. I also assisted in the debugging of the entire system and assembling the electrical system.

The software system has two components: a python backend, which interprets guitar tablature and creates a GUI, and an arduino script, which controls the mechanical components. The two interact through the serial port of the arduino.

Our electrical system is centered around an Arduino Uno microprocessor. Because the Arduino Uno doesnâ€™t possess enough output channels to power all of our solenoids and our lock actuators, we used three Logos Electromechanical 4x4 driver shields which provided us with 48 high power outputs as opposed to the 13 we could use off the arduino. Outputs were assigned to individual solenoids or to half h-bridge chips (L293Ds) that allow us to drive our lock actuators in both directions. The three boards and the Arduino were powered off of a desktop computer power supply at five volts for the lock actuators and twelve volts for the solenoids.

In order to press the fret to tune a note we used 30 pull solenoids. The challenge of using these was  finding a way to fit 30 solenoids within the span of 5 frets at the top of the guitar, with room to attach them to a fret actuation system. In the end, we designed two, three-tiered shelving units that stagger the solenoids laterally, allowing us to dedicate a single string of the guitar to each string. We then used sheet metal parts to transfer power from the solenoids to the strings and neck of the guitar.

Our strumming mechanism is composed of a structural component, linear car-door lock actuators, and finger-like pick-holding extensions. The structural component is created from several laser-cut MDF pieces.  Each structural component holds three linear car-door lock actuators side-by-side. The linear car-door lock actuators are powered by 5 volts. By reversing the voltage, we were able to make the actuators move in and out of their casing. The finger-like pick-holding extensions are connected to the linear car-door lock actuators by small acrylic plates and fasteners and hold picks.

When the semeter ended, our team decided to continue working on the guitar project to improve it for permanent display. There is now a web-interface to choose a song and is run off of a raspberry pi. The electrical system is much more reliable and safe and the mechanical system is robust and tuned.
