I, along with a group of mechanical and electrical engineers, decided to take a class project to the next level. We began this project for a Principles of Engineering course, which required us to create something with an electrical, mechanical and software component. We decided to make a Robotic Player Guitar. I am the software lead on the team and in charge of the interface, backend and embedded system. Before even starting the project, our professor warned us that we were taking on a task much greater than the class required or that he thought we could handle in this time period. But, we were driven to make this work. Which may be why after it successfully worked for the class, we are still improving it (two years later) for permanent display at Olin College.

Our first iteration was driven by an Arduino Uno and controlled by a python backend. I wrote code to interpret Guitar Tablature, communicate across a serial port to an Arduino, convert it into a binary string and control the actuators and solinoids via SPI.

The second iteration takes MIDI files as inputs and uses an Arduino Due to provide more power.

The current iteration is run off of a NodeJS Web App and is controlled by a RaspberryPi.
