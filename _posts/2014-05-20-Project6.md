For a data science course, my partner and I evaluated the reactions of doctors to directives published by the National Health Service of the UK. This was specifically related to drugs that the doctors prescribed to patients, relative to either generic or similar versions. We worked with the National Healh Service's Open Data that they published in a transparency initiative. We built a [timeseries](https://www.dropbox.com/s/eviombgon1jb9ji/NSAIDmapTimeseries.avi?dl=0) which displays how each of the different regions reacted to a directive by time.
