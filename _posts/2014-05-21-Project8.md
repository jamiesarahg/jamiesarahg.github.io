For Olinâ€™s User Oriented Collaborative Design course, I worked on a team to understand and design for volunteer physicians. In a semester, we took the challenge of making a significant impact on the lives of Volunteer Physicians. On a team of five students, we engaged in a User Centered Design process where we challenged ourselves to epathize and understand our users. We visited clinics and hospitals, interviewed physicians and researched the work of our users. We identified areas of opportunities, which helped us build personas and journies to extract deeper meaning. We ferociously ideated ideas and codesigned with our users.
In the end, we developed the S2, an intellegent note-taking add-on to a stethosocope. Volunteer physicians resent the overhaul of their field by technology and reject doctors who spend their appointment time glued to the computer instead of interacting with patients. We were able to turn their apprehension towards technology into an asset by designing a device which would help the physicians increase time interacting with their patients.
