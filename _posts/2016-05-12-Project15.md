For my capstone project in engineering, I am building a design application for children aged six to fourteen in conjunction with DS SolidWorks. Along with developing the software, I am leading the user research and managing the collaboration with the company. We conducted the user studies to aid us in developing a product which will better target a young audience, not currently reached by SolidWorks. My capstone experience implements research theories into practical applications and brings the project-based learning models a step closer to the average classroom. 

At Solidworks World in January, Dassaut announced our project. We are creating Capture It, the brainstorming application in Apps for Kids. [Check it out here!](http://appsforkids.solidworks.com/)
