For my capstone project in engineering, I am building a design application for children aged six to fourteen in conjunction with DS SolidWorks. Along with developing software, I am leading the user research and managing the collaboration with the company. We conducted the user studies to aid us in developing a product which will better target a young audience, not currently reached by SolidWorks. While the details of the product are confidential, I can reveal that it will expose students to the creative aspects of engineering and the design process. Working on this project is a small step to realizing my goals as I am developing an application to prepare users to tackle their own projects. My capstone experience implements research theories into practical applications and brings the project-based learning models a step closer to the average classroom.
