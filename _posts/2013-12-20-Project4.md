For a computer architecture coure, we made an FPGA piano. We programmed an FPGA to play simple music. We attempted to implement two different kinds of modes: a free-play mode where the user was able to play a combination of seven different notes in a major scale and a song mode where a predetermined song would play. In order to produce different notes, we divided the FPGA's clock by different values which yielded the various notes we wanted. We opted to use seven separate GPIO pins on the FPGA to produce notes, and we were able to play all the notes using a single speaker by building a simple analog signal adder.
