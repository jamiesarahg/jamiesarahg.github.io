I wanted to investigate if the lexicon of a president's inaugural speech is related to president's political party affiliation or the date of the speech. I used natural language processing and data visualization techniques to visualize the 700 top "buzzwords" in the inaugural speech corpus. I then used how often each president brought up these buzzwords in their speeches to create a graph of all the inaugural speeches. 

I compared these graphs to the data on when the speech was given and the political party that the speaker was affiliated with. I found that the buzzwords used in a given inaugural speech closely align with the date of the speech. For example, buzzwords like "militia" and "tariff" are commonplace for our founding fathers to use, while words such as "communism" and "Cuba" are buzzwords relating to 20th century politics. 

The buzzwords I found encapsulate both words relevant to current events, such as "Cuba" and "Communism,"" and also variations in the English language, such as the previously popular word "whilst". It remains to be investigated if the inaugural speeches can be better differentiated based on words pertaining to current events or words based on the evolution of American English. This is something that I would like to look into, creating a more intuitive and interactive visualization of the inaugural speeches.
