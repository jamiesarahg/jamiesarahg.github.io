For a 'Physics: Electricity and Magnetism' course, my partner and I designed and executed a classroom lesson and activity for third graders. Through easily comprehendible demonstrations, we showed them the principles of electricity and magnetism in order to explain how a motor worked.  Then students then each built their own motor by putting the principles they just learned into action. We ran this curricula for three classes. By the end of the lesson, the students had a basic understanding of the workings of a motor. Above, you can see and example of the motor that they built using the activity instructions, below. Below, you can see my partner Rahil working with students at the school.
