For a Physics: Electricity and Magnetism Course, my partner and I designed and executed a classroom lesson and activity for third graders. We taught them the principles of electricity and magnetism through easily comprehendible demos. The students then each built their own motor by putting the principles they just learned into action. Above, you can see and example of the motor that they built using the activity instructions, below. Below, you can see my partner Rahil working with students at the school
