For my capstone project in engineering at Olin College, I built a design application for children aged six to fourteen for DS SolidWorks. We conducted user studies to aid us in developing a product to target a young audience, not currently reached by SolidWorks. Capture It is the brainstorming application in DS SolidWorks's new product: Apps for Kids. It will soon be released in Beta with the other initial apps in Apps for Kids.
