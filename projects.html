      <a href="/Project18"><p><b>Designing a PBL Design Environment:</b></p></a>
      We conducted an iterative design-based research study to find out how we can design a scalable and desirable learning environment for highly ill-structured problems that teaches problem analysis and planning so that teams innovate more effectively through rapid iteratioin. We conducted this study in a 6-week full-time extracurricular design program with 22 undergraduate students in a US university. </p>

      I worked on the initial prototypes of TunePad, which introduces learners to computational thinking while leveraging their creativity in composing music. We hope to  balance playful, informal learning while also preparing learners for formal computing environments.</p>

        <!-- <p>My team and I developed, built and deployed the Brightbox and the associated curriculum to aid in teaching kids optics. The Brightbox is used in schools in rural India and Ghana to encourage exploratory learning and a curiosity for science. I project-managed a team of engineering and business students and professors and worked with two partners, Agastya International Foundation and African Women Advocacy Project to work towards our goal.</p> -->
