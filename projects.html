       <p> We are exploring how students evaluate their programming intelligence while in CS1. First, we evaluated how students talk about mindset and how their mindset towards intelligence may impact their behaviors. We next explored the moments in the programming process that cause students to feel like they can not succeed in CS. We then designed a qualitative codebook and automated expert system to detect the moments in the programming process that cause students to negatively self-assess.</p>

    <p><h3>Exploring Why Novice Programmers Have Negative Perceptions</h3></p>

     <p>We have begun a few additional studies to further explore why students have these perceptions of programming intelligence. We are exploring student perceptions of professional programmers, their sense of belonging and their self-critical bias.</p>

      We conducted an iterative design-based research study to find out how we can design a scalable and desirable learning environment for highly ill-structured problems that teaches problem analysis and planning so that teams innovate more effectively through rapid iteratioin. We conducted this study in a 6-week full-time extracurricular design program with 22 undergraduate students in a US university. </p>

      I worked on the initial prototypes of TunePad, which introduces learners to computational thinking while leveraging their creativity in composing music. We hope to  balance playful, informal learning while also preparing learners for formal computing environments.
