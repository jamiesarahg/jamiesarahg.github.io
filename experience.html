<p> <b> September 2013-Present - Needham, MA </b> </p>
<p>  I was the liaison to visitors coming to learn about <a href="http://olin.edu">Olin College’s</a> unique approach to teaching engineering. As a liaison, I informed the visiting deans and professors about Olin’s academic structure and helped them envision how to apply it in the context of their own programs by bringing visitors to different laboratories and classrooms on campus, explaining the structure and pedagogical method behind the coursework. In doing so, I influenced the incorporation of project-based and hands-on learning into the education of students around the globe.</p>
