<p> <b> September 2013-Present - Needham, MA </b> </p>
<p>  I am the liaison to many visitors who come to learn about Olin College’s unique approach to teaching engineering. As a liaison, I inform the visiting deans and professors about Olin’s academic structure and help them envision how to apply it in the context of their own programs. I bring visitors to different laboratories and classrooms on campus, explaining the structure and pedagogical method behind the coursework. In doing so, I influence the incorporation of project-based and hands-on learning into the education of students around the globe. Concurrently, I learn about other institutions’ challenges of incorporating new pedagogical models into existing programs and reforming an established system and culture.  </p>
