I worked with a team to identify needs and values of people who help the homeless in order to create a product specifically for them.

Specifically, we began this project by getting to know our user group, volunteering at homeless shelters and soup kitchens to understand what motivates people to volunteer to help the homeless. Next, we created personas of our user group and determined the areas of opportunity within this space. We then brainstormed ideas, co-designed with our users to flesh out a few promising ideas, and ultimately settled on creating the S.O.S. Messenger Bag.

The bag is designed to be a symbol of a volunteer's efforts. Since there is often little communication between shelters, many volunteers feel as if their efforts to help the homeless are isolated -- they can only do so much. They voiced that they would like to be able to know who shares this common interest in volunteering. We decided to design a messenger bag, as it is an item that people wear everyday and is placed prominently on their person. Volunteers can choose to broadcast that they spent their time volunteering by wearing this bright orange, distinct bag. 

As the prompt for the project was to design a product that could be made ten years in the future, one of the functionalities of this bag was that it displayed volunteer's stories using e-ink. Every time a volunteer passed someone else wearing a bag, their stories would swap, and they would get to read a paragraph about someone else's experience volunteering. This helps with making the volunteers aware that they are part of a greater effort to help the homeless, while still being a passive device that does not interfere with their (very busy) daily lives.
